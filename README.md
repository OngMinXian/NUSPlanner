## Project description :fountain_pen:
NUSPlanner is a productivity-centric web application that utilises statistics and visual summaries to give users a clear view of their time-management in three areas: work, academics and extracurricular activities. This empowers users to manage their priorities effectively so that they can acquire the relevant skills to boost their employability and differentiate themselves from their peers. 

Adhering to its core focus of catering to student demographics, NUSPlanner is integrated with NUSMODS, a popular module planning website for students, so that students can also track their modular progress. This ensures that users of NUSPlanner remain focused on their goals and stay ahead of the game at all times.

## Motivation :fire:
Contrary to popular belief, education is no longer the golden ticket to employment in Singapore.

According to a report by professional networking platform LinkedIn, **39% of companies in Singapore look for employees with technical skills, which is nearly 2 times higher than companies who value traditional qualifications such as education and working experience.**

If acquiring an arsenal of technical skills like programming and design are not enough to cause headaches for an undergraduate looking to secure his first job, being part of an ever-growing population of university graduates certainly would. 

As of 2020, being **ONE in the 33% of Singaporean degree holders** translates to being ** ONE in 1.9 million**, or more conveniently, **0.0000526% of Singaporeans coveting employment.** The oversaturation of skilled workers in the local job industry can cause the job search for an undergraduate to turn aggressive, or even abusive very quickly as they compete relentlessly with many hopefuls to land their first job.

With this problem in mind, we hope to design a user-friendly application that will help undergraduates remain cognisant of both their working portfolio and academic progress early on in their university journey. This way, much despair and anxiety can be averted, as one can do the necessary homework and preparation needed to land his dream job
