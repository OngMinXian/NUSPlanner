## Project description :memo:
NUSPlanner is a <b>productivity-centric web application</b> that utilises statistics and visual summaries to give users a <b>clear view of their time-management</b> in three areas: work, academics and extracurricular activities. This <b>empowers users to manage their priorities effectively</b> so that they can acquire the relevant skills to boost their employability and differentiate themselves from their peers. 

Adhering to its core focus of catering to student demographics, NUSPlanner is <b>integrated with NUSMODS</b>, a popular module planning website for students, so that students can also <b>track their modular progress</b>. This ensures that users of NUSPlanner remain focused on their goals and stay ahead of the game at all times.

## Motivation :fire:
Contrary to popular belief, education is no longer the ticket to employment in Singapore.

According to a report by professional networking platform LinkedIn, 

> 39% of companies in Singapore look for employees with technical skills

which is **nearly 2 times higher** than companies who value traditional qualifications such as education and working experience[^1].

[^1]: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/singapore-employers-prioritise-skills-over-education-experience-linkedin-survey#:~:text=SINGAPORE%20(THE%20BUSINESS%20TIMES)%20%2D,LinkedIn%20said%20in%20a%20report

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/172121911-2c98bb6b-dd3d-44b1-b89d-515441a20abe.png">
</p>

If acquiring an arsenal of technical skills like programming and design are not enough to cause headaches for an undergraduate looking to secure his first job, being part of an ever-growing population of university graduates certainly would. 

As of 2020, being **ONE in the 33% of Singaporean degree holders[^2]** translates to being **ONE in 1.9 million**, or more conveniently, **0.0000526% of Singaporeans coveting employment.** The oversaturation of skilled workers in the local job industry can cause the job search for an undergraduate to turn aggressive, or even abusive very quickly as they compete relentlessly with many hopefuls to land their first job.

[^2]: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-population-better-educated-across-age-ethnicity-women-make-greater-strides

With this problem in mind, we hope to design a user-friendly application that will help undergraduates remain cognisant of both their working portfolio and academic progress early on in their university journey. This way, much despair and anxiety can be averted, as one can do the necessary homework and preparation needed to land his dream job

## Installation and Set-Up :hammer_and_wrench:
1. Install react-js from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
2. Clone from GitHub repository: https://github.com/OngMinXian/NUSPlanner
3. Navigate to the src folder and install the following dependencies 
``` bash 
npm i react-router-dom
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5 
npm install --save react-big-calendar --legacy-peer-deps
npm i react-datepicker
npm i react-datetime-picker
npm i date-fns
npm i styled-components
npm i react-icons
npm i react-select
npm i react-chartjs-2 chart.js 
npm i react-circular-progressbar
npm i react-heatmap-grid
```
:exclamation: **IMPORTANT:** 
- **Command to install react-bootstrap has not been tested yet, previous one that did not work is: npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@4.6.0** <br/>
- **bootstrap version must be compatible with react bootstrap version in order for styling to work properly. Visit this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65472384/react-bootstrap-only-close-button-styling-not-working) for troubleshooting if such an issue is encountered**

5. Within the src folder, install the dependencies for the Firebase database:
```bash 
npm i firebase
```
6. Create the .env.local file containing the Firebase API keys
  - This file should be created on the same level as the src folder
  - Email Shanice at e0774411@u.nus.edu for details on the Firebase API keys

## Software Engineering Practices :gear:

### Approach to software design :computer:
We adopted a [bottom-up approach](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-top-down-and-bottom-up-integration-testing/) towards multi-level design in Milestone 1. 

<p align = "center">
<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/172364575-37e8bcd9-0b3d-4692-bfa1-53a9b49dc7b8.png">
</p>

As novices in software engineering, **producing code for the layout and design of the web application was our first priority** as it would allow us to produce a user interface, as well as to hone our understanding of HTML, CSS and ReactJS. 

We then **proceeded to develop more technical features that involved routing, hooks and interactivity** after we gained proficiency in styling our web page. During this rudimentary stage, we directed our focus to develop the basic functionalities required for each web page before adding in any interactive features that would be triggered by user input (eg. Coding out the calendar layout properly in the Calendar Page before implementing the drag and drop functionality). This bottom-up approach helped us to understand the limitations of our code and the packages that we chose to use, enabling us to make well-informed decisions about the features that we wished to implement.

Finally, we **integrated the users' account information and in-application data to Firebase.** This step was crucial in binding our the frontend and backend of our web application together, enabling us to produce a viable end product. We strongly feel that the bottom-up approach helped us to develop the fundamental aspects of our web application effectively, thus we will continue to use this approach for future milestones.

### Project management and planning :spiral_notepad:
Approximately **12 man days, the equivalent of 96 hours,** was channelled towards the coding of our web application in Milestone 1, with the breakdown of tasks by duration (in days) as follows:

<p align = "center">
  <img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/180628679-d613c401-d639-4c78-bdf3-1ed216090d06.png">
</p>

A significantly **larger proportion of time was allocated towards learning the tech stacks required,** coding the required functionalities, as well as reading and writing data from our web application to Firestore. 

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/175554224-07d3f801-9c6e-4dff-bec0-f0c5ce2cbd43.png">
</p>

We decided to place greater emphasis on these areas in order to deepen our understanding of the tech stacks and to set-up our web application adequately for more advanced functionalities in the future.

While coding, we **frequently compiled our code and tested it on the deployment server.** Code was uploaded to GitHub only after multiple tests were run to prevent errors. Branching was also used to implement new features and pull requests were initiated each time a merge was executed.

On top of merging and checking for prospective loopholes in our code, we added succinct commit messages on GitHub wherever possible to track changes made to the code and to ensure the consistency of our code at all times.

## Testing :test_tube:	
The link to our testing documentation in Milestone 2 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hBhq1a3CiRDjgi2CvH-hZ4rq1_3fXINYQnzB3uom-E/edit?usp=sharing). <br /> 

## Software Engineering Practices :gear:

### Approach to software design :computer:
Our web application is modelled using the **n-tier architectural style** and the **event-driven architectural style.** 

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/175817780-2f8bcb68-295b-4192-9e37-5b21ffd8f2fb.png">
</p>

The n-tier architectural style was chosen because it is **complements our bottom-up approach towards multi-level design.** In a bottom-up approach, developing basic functionalities are a top priority because they are the foundation for progressively advanced features in an application. This means that as developers, we are always working on a range of components that, when put together, form a feature in our web application. Therefore, we must **reduce dependencies within our code** so that new features can be seamlessly integrated within our system and exisitng features can be refined without leading to conflicts. 

Using the [n-tier architectural style](https://stackify.com/n-tier-architecture/) allows us to develop various components of our web application effectively because it involves ***dividing our application into 3 tiers: the presentation tier  the logic tier and the data tier.***

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/175817982-8c642fa5-109b-414c-aced-b174331afe8b.png">
</p>

Due to the structually distinct nature of each layer, we can introduce new features to any of the 3 layers without introducing undesirable side-effects to the remaining layers. This not only **gives rise to scalability**, but **code reusability** as well, since we can easily abstract out existing ideas and use them to develop related ideas in our web application. 

The [event-driven architectural style](https://se-education.org/se-book/architecture/architecturalStyles/eventDriven/) was also used in our web application as we had to stage and trigger a wide range of event sequences based on user-input. 

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/175818278-ac7c35f1-ee09-4f1e-9690-326acac6123e.png">
</p>

For example, when a user decides to add an event in the Calendar page, he has to key in several input fields. Every character that he adds or deletes from the input fields triggers a state change in the related hook, which in turn causes the object hook containing the new event to be updated. Ensuring that the **correct event sequences are triggered based on a unique set of actions by the user** is thus central to the success of our web application.

While we do acknowledge that other architectural styles have their own merits, with the peer-to-peer pattern and the client-server architectural style being exceptionally useful in distributed applications, these architectural styles were less applicable to us as our web application is not being developed on an industrial scale. 

### Project management and planning :spiral_notepad:

Approximately **15 man days, the equivalent of 120 hours,** was directed towards coding new functionalities, fixing technical issues, testing and deploying our web application in Milestone 2, with the breakdown of tasks by duration (in days) as follows: 

<p align = "center">
  <img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/180628746-4695761b-f296-4aee-814f-657ccc577462.png">
 </p>

After gaining familiarity with the tech stacks in Milestone 1, our **main focus in Milestone 2 was to set up as many functionalities as we could** in our web application. The process of setting up each page was prolonged because we **conducted extensive error checks** and had to resolve the technical issues that we discovered. 

<p align = "center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/175822643-596e187a-0a2c-4749-b5ab-d907b008c4a7.png">
</p>

The quantity of the code produced in Milestone 2 was significantly greater than in Milestone 1, hence there was an urgent need for proper communication and project planning. Apart from updating each other about our progress in coding and the changes that we made to the code files, we **updated the technical aspect of our README regularly** to ensure that the set-up procedure is up-to-date. We also **created issues in our GitHub page** for technical difficulties that we struggled to resolve. 

## Technical difficulties encountered :toolbox:

| Nature of Issue  | Reference on GitHub | Solved/Open | Follow-up |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Challenges deploying web application on Firebase | [Issue 6](https://github.com/OngMinXian/NUSPlanner/issues/6) | Solved | Consulted student advisor <br></br> Solved by editing out the return statements in our useEffect hooks for the affected pages |

## Direction for Milestone 3 :arrow_right:

The technical aspect of Milestone 2 was extremely demanding for us as we tried our best to code as many functionalities as possible and made it our priority to check our code extensively for technical problems. As a result, most of our time was channelled towards random testing and fixing the issues that were visible to us. 

In Milestone 3, we hope that we can **pivot towards more organised forms of testing** through conducting unit tests or even system tests. We endeavour to set aside more time for **experimenting with different testing frameworks** and to **familiarise ourselves with the syntax used in software testing packages** like chai. At the same time, completing all the deliverables that we have planned under the <a href = "#ms3-deliver">Timeline and Executables section for Milestone 3</a> remains equally important to us. 

Moving forward, we will seek the advice of our student advisor and mentor, and use their feedback to make meaningful decisions about the future direction of our project.

Users can view their progress of the day's tasks through a progress bar for the 4 main categories: Work, CCA, Academics, Others <br></br> &emsp; b. A stacked bar plot gives users a breakdown of the time that they spend across the Work, CCA and Academics categories <br></br> &emsp; c. The stacked bar plot supports 3 different views (past week, past month and past year) <br></br> 4. Implemented the Sleep Quality segment :sleeping_bed: <br></br> &emsp; a. Users can view the frequency that each sleep quality rating (categorical variable) occurs using a heatmap <br></br> &emsp; b. The trend in users' sleep duration is represented through a line graph <br></br> &emsp; c. All visualisations in this segment support 3 different views (past week, past month, past year) <br></br> 4. Manipulated and read user input from the database to transform data into the format required for the data visualisations | Not applicable |
| Progress Report page :card_index_dividers: | 1. Implemented the contact details, education details and write-up sections <br></br> &emsp; a. Users can view their relevant user data eg. Name, course details, CAP etc. as part of the resume generated <br></br> &emsp; b. Users can also add links to their LinkedIn account, website and a description of their positive attributes <br></br> &emsp;c. All user input will be saved in the Firestore database <br></br> &emsp;d. Information displayed under the Experience, Education and Extracurriculars section of the write-up originate from tasks/events that users have chosen to log in the Progress Report upon task/event creation | Not applicable |
| Additional Features :ladder: | 1. Added custom error and success messages to all pages of the web application <br></br> &emsp; a. Included error checks to prevent form submission whenever input given by the user is invalid eg. User provides numbers as part of his faculty name, Science123 instead of Science <br></br> &emsp; b. Error messages are more specific to assist the user in troubleshooting eg. User will be notified that the event start time should come before the event end time when he has not specified the event start time correctly, rather than a generic error message that his inputs were invalid | Not applicable |

### Database Diagram :film_strip:
In Milestone 3, we have finalised our database diagram. Due to how Firebase works, we have decided to **store only one class which is the Users class.** This allows the query to search for the correct user ID and retrieve all the user's information. This is **faster compared to having many classes** such as events and modules where each query would look through the entire relevant database to find which one matches the user ID. The diagram below shows how **data is being written to and retrieved from the database for each page through a series of functions**. 

<p align = "center">
<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/180628063-73c023db-aa06-4f3c-b199-21cdf2a1b42e.png">
</p>

### Quality Assurance :vertical_traffic_light:
In Milestone 3, we directed our efforts towards **implementing system testing, regression testing and user testing.** 

Despite having attempted to implement automated testing in Milestone 2 with the aid of Mocha, Chai and Enzyme, we ultimately **decided to go with a non-automated approach.** One important reason is because our **system is heavily reliant on user gestures** to generate specific outcomes, and these **gestures cannot be replicated using a testing framework.** 

For example, when a user resizes a calendar event or chooses to move it across diffferent timeslots in the Calendar page, he would have to perform a set of precise actions with his mouse. Simulating these gestures using a UI testing framework would not be feasible, and is further complicated by the need to check whether the shifted event has retained its associated properties, such as its title. 

Furthermore, there are **many elements to each component in our web application**, contributing to the **mounting challenges of checking the UI of each component.** 

This is evident in the Today page, where creating an event that falls on the present day will cause an dropdown tab to appear in the events section. In this scenario, it would be insufficient to merely test whether a dropdown tab has appeared after the event has been added. The tests run should extend towards checking the visual effect of adding one event to other exisiting events, as well as opening the dropdown tab to check whether all event details have been stated correctly. Given the vast quantities of visual elements that we have to look out for, non-automated testing would be a more accurate and efficient alternative to unit or integrated testing.

Therefore, non-automated testing was used as it will help us to create a **more polished end product within an optimal period of time.**

### Evidence of regression testing :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
We **run a fixed set of test cases on our web application after changes are being made.** This ensures that all our components are mounted properly and that no unwanted side effects are introduced as a result of our edits. To view the documentation of our test cases, please click here (insert link to Google Docs). 

### Evidence of system testing :microscope:

#### Usability Testing :footprints:
Please refer to the section titled <a href = "#user-test3">Evidence of user testing</a> below

#### Compatibility Testing :closed_lock_with_key:
Our web application is being developed on the macOS and Windows operating systems. The **appearance and functionality of our web application remains optimal** on both operating systems. 

#### Performance Testing :athletic_shoe:
We have conducted **performance tests as part of our load tests** (see Load Testing section below). Our application **reponds quickly even when large volumes of data are being processed.** This is applicable for the Dashboard page too, as users can switch between different time spans without significant lags or disruptions to the data visualisations. 

#### Security Testing :oncoming_police_car:
We have **created private routing** in our web application, hence users can access pages beyond the login, forget password or signup pages only when they have successfully logged in. Modifying the website link to access the pages within the web application will cause users to be redirected to the login page. 

Additionally, the **risk of existing accounts being hacked is minimised** as new accounts cannot be created under emails that are currently registered under existing accounts.

#### Load Testing :balance_scale:
Our dashboard page and progress report page require a substantial amount of data to be logged by the user before they can become fully functional. This is especially so for the dashboard page which supports a yearly view for certain segments that are being analysed. 

Given how our web application is only developed in 2022, it would not be possible for us to access user data from 2021 that has been organically generated. Thus we have **used a pre-loaded document with large quantities of data synced to our Firestore database** as a substitute. Users can access this data by creating a new account under the name "tester". Wherever possible, the **data in this document is generated randomly,** giving user-custom views for: events/tasks, modules, as well as sleep and stress data. 

By creating accounts that are linked to this pre-loaded data, we can effectively **simulate the process of accessing a range of user-generated data** during testing. This allows us to gain a heightened **awareness of how the visual components of our web application respond to a wide spectrum of data**, so our user interface can be modified to accommodate different quantities and values of data. 

On top of refining our UI, we have also **used the large quantities of data to test the efficiency** of our web application when it has to process heavy loads. In total, we have **generated 865 data entries,** with the breakdown of data entries by category as follows:

| Category | Code | Lines of Data Generated |
| ----------  | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Tasks |![Screenshot 2022-07-21 at 11 43 10 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/180256734-b7333d04-ddc9-47e2-8d3b-840fc1385798.png)| **5** |

### <a name = "user-test3"></a>Evidence of user testing :busts_in_silhouette:
Since the target audience of our web application is NUS students, we have decided to only include NUS students in our user testing group. We approached students across different faculties and year of study. We asked users to first test the web application freely. Afterwards, we provided users with a test account that has randomly generated data in order to allow users to use some of the features that requires data to be collected across long periods of time. Feedback was collected in the table below.

| No. | Year | Course | Feedback | Actionables | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | 1 | Computer Science | You can add events that have start date after end date. | Added error message when this occurs. Also added error messages for when any of the other require inputs are empty. Also added alert messages when actions are completed succesfully. |
| 2 | 1 | Business Analytics | Unable to edit events on the calendar. I need to resort to deleting and then adding a new event in order to edit an existing event | Added feature to edit events directly from the calendar. Also moved event details from bottom of the screen to right of the screen for better viewing. |
| 3 | 1 | Life Science | Existing events are duplicated at times when events are added | Bug fixed. |
| 4 | 2 | Life Science | Error message for empty tag name does not disappear after closing the pop-up | Bug fixed. |
| 5 | 2 | Business |  Can consider having an option to choose which events to add to the progress report as having everything displayed by default is very messy. | Gave users option to include event/task into progress report in the creating event/task popup. Also allowed users to edit this option in the view event details feature of the calendar. |
| 6 | 2 | Business | When you click task done and select cancel, the checkbox remains ticked. | Bug fixed. |
| 7 | 2 | Economics | Add to Progress Report feature should not be restricted to events, and should include tasks | Reconsidered and added tasks to progress report to not limit user's flexibility in using the web application. |
| 8 | 3 | Biomedical Engineering | Graph changes very slowly for dashboard. Very laggy and seemingly unresponsive. | Bug fixed by changing animation time for graphs. |
| 9 | 3 | Chemical Engineering | Does not support languages other than English. | Unfortunately due to time constraints, we are not looking into this as we assume that most users of our web application are proficient in English |
| 10 | 3 | Law | Profile picture shows error image before loading. | Bug fixed. |
| 11 | 3 | Law | Clicking the save changes button in the Course Details section without making any changes deletes every module. | Bug fixed. |
| 12 | 4 | Law | Overall CAP displays NaN when there are no modules logged. | Bug fixed by replacing NaN with 0. |
| 13 | 4 | Social Science | Tester account already has sleep and stress logged for the day upon creation. | Bug fixed. |


### Project management and planning :spiral_notepad:
Approximately **13 man days, the equivalent of 104 hours,** was dedicated to completing our web application, enhancing the performance of existing functionalities and rectifying technical issues, with the breakdown of tasks by duration (in days) as follows:

<p align = "center">
<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/180224618-3caa3e8b-5996-4a2c-a820-1ced84a89def.png">
</p>

**Figuring out a coherent direction for the Dashboard page and Progress report page was our greatest challenge in Milestone 3** as we had long grappled with the task of deriving actionable insights from the user data collected. Fortunately we managed to gain inspiration and produced the code and design for these pages in a much shorter period of time than we had initially anticipated. 

<p align = "center">
<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79785001/180611319-852d7c52-29d1-43aa-84f0-45d9509604b1.png">
</p>

Our rapid progress through the Dashboard and Progress Report pages gave us the allowance to **improve the performance and usability of our web application.** In the days that followed, we **tested the web application extensively** on a regular basis, **adding validation checks** which would prevent erroneous user inputs from being registered in our Firebase backend. We also **added custom error and success messages** for greater clarity and ease of troubleshooting. 

Apart from conducting system tests on our end, we **invited many students from diverse backgrounds to test our web application** and enhanced our functionalities based on their feedback. The greater degree of interaction that we had with our target audience, existing NUS students, was crucial to helping us build a modern and reponsive system that is relevant to users' lives.

## Technical difficulties encountered :toolbox:
No significant technical difficulties were encountered in Milestone 3. However, we did consult our student advisor on the relevance of unit/integrated tests for our web application

## Direction for Splashdown :arrow_right:
Unlike Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 which were very technically rigorous, Milestone 3 was a test of our endurance and work ethic as we had to stay focused on refining the existing features of our web application, even after we had deemed it as complete. 

On multiple occasions, our perspective of our work was cast in uncertainty as we discovered many technical issues and areas for improvement during testing. While these were moments of frustration, they were also humbling as we learned to evaluate our work with a more critical mindset and to remain consistent in realising loftier goals for our project. 

As Milestone 3 draws to close, we will take the feedback received into serious consideration and make the necessary improvements so that we can present a well-rounded product that is representative of our commitment to this project.
