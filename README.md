## Project description 
NUSPlanner is a productivity-centric web application that utilises statistics and visual summaries to give users a clear view of their time-management in three areas: work, academics and extracurricular activities. This empowers users to manage their priorities effectively so that they can acquire the relevant skills to boost their employability and differentiate themselves from their peers. Adhering to its core focus of catering to student demographics, NUSPlanner is integrated with NUSMODS, a popular module planning website for students, so that students can also track their modular progress. This ensures that users of NUSPlanner remain focused on their goals and stay ahead of the game at all times.
